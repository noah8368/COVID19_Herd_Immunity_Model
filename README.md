# Herd Immunity Prediction Model

#### Summary

This repository contains a simplified model which attempts to take into account
several factors to generate a conservative prediction that serves as a
lower bound on when the US could reach herd immunity. The model attempts to 
take into account: the increased transmission capability of the new B.1.1.7 
strain, the probability that a vaccination individual has already had COVID19, 
the probability of reinfection, the percentage of unreported cases, the predicted
number of future cases, and the ability of the US to vaccinate individuals.
